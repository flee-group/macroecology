# Special Topics in Ecology: Macroecology
**Instructor**: Matthew Talluto

**Office**: Technikerstraße 25, Room 506

**Meeting location**:  
All virtual 

## Course Description
We will explore major concepts and advances in macroecology through a combination of lecture, literature discussion, and practicals. Topics to be covered may include niches, species distributions, distributions and origins of biodiversity, species interactions, and human interactions with macroecology.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe major macroecological patterns
* Connect processes at smaller scales with macroecological patterns
* Critically evaluate current literature
* Compare methodological approaches
* Design macroecological models and identify approapriate data sources

## Exercises & Assignments
* **Paper discussions**: We will discuss some relatively recent literature during lecture and/or seminar times. Students will be asked to read the papers in advance and come prepared with a few discussion points, and to participate actively in the discussions.
* **Coding exercises**: The rest of the seminar time will be spent model building. Most code for building the models will be provided, so the focus will be on exploring different variables, interpreting results, and checking model performance. **Coding exercises won't be graded.** They are here to help you understand the models and to prepare you for the final project.
* **Final project**: Choose a macroecological dataset (either your own, one found via a data source presented in class, or one of the datasets we've used for the exercises). Develop, in consultation with the instructor one or two macro-scale hypotheses relevant to the dataset. Design and implement a (reasonably) complete analysis testing your hypothesis. Present your results in the form of a short report; this should include the usual parts of a short-form scientific paper (Intro, Results & Discussion, Methods). Code and data for your model should be prepared in a self-contained manner and provided as an appendix. If you do not have permission to share the data, this is ok, but consult with the instructor beforehand. The project can be done individually or in a small (2-3 person) group. **Due**: 31.08.2021

## Assessment
* Participation (lecture, discussions, coding exercises): 50%
* Final project: 50%
